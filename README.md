# midway-dev-env
An attempt to recreate a dev environment for TMS34010 based Midway Arcade Games (Z, T, X, Wolf Unit) in an effort to build the source for games based on this hardware. This project does not include any source code of the Midway games. Do not ask where to get them either.

## Requirement:
Source code should be located at '../midwaysource/\<game\>'

## TODO:
- Spend some time analyzing code and figure out what tools exist in each repo
- Figure out which tools to use for Unix->DOS tools
- Create a DOSBOX dev env
- Try to run MK2 Sound build in DOSBox
- Try to use Graphics tools from NBA Hangtime to build MK Graphics roms
- Try to build any game that does have the program rom makefiles available

# Z Unit (1988)
## Narc
Have been told this game is fully buildable.

# Y Unit (1990)

## Trog

## Smash TV

## Total Carnage

# T Unit (1993)

## NBA Jam

## Mortal Kombat 2
Seems like the tools to build the graphics ROMs are missing, but these tools seem to be available (alongside documentation) in the NBA Hangtime code.

## NBA Jam TE

# X Unit (1994)

## Revolution X
Seems to have the TMS34010 asm tools as well as a version of MAKE.

# Wolf Unit (1995)

## WWF Wrestlemania

## Mortal Kombat 3

## 2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge

## NBA Hangtime
Includes the VDASTUFF graphics tooling alongside documentation on how to use
