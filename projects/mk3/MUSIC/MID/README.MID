                Track Assignments for MK III Tunes                ----------------------------------        Here are track assignments for K2000 patches.  If you load your        K2000 as described below, everything should hopefully be in the        right place.                   Bank           File                   ----           ----                Bank 200-299     K200S                Bank 300-399     K300S                Bank 400-499     CHOIRHRP (on tune "pit")                Bank 500-599     MK3                Bank 700-799     CHOIRHRP (on tune "church")                Bank 700-799     NOFEAR (on tune "bridge")                Bank 700-799     SHAKU (on tune "pit")        I also include Banks 0-199 in case yours is different.        I will send you the samples for all remaining tracks and stereo        mixes in April.        My K2000 has the additional ROM-1 orchestral sample set installed.        If you have it, there should be no problem, otherwise, since those        are ROM samples, I can't seem to save them on disk.  Some sounds        will be affected (#380, #381, and anything in bank 900-999).  I'll        either figure it out or just send those samples later in SDII form.                - Train (Subway Station):                - K2000 Tracks:           MIDI Chan.
