 
Basketball Game Controls & Moves - 3/24/92

*****************************************************************************

Layout for Controls on Offense:

* STICK    * PASS  * SHOOT/REBOUND
	       * TURBO/FAKE

The 8-way stick will always control the on screen player you have chosen.
The buttons however will affect the drone player. (Assuming another human is
not controlling him)

SHOOT/REBOUND Button:
- If your team has possession (Holding onto it) of the ball then:
	- Elevates player who has possession of ball.
	- The computer decides if the ball carrier will take a JUMP SHOT or
	  DRIVE TO THE HOOP (Player would at least have to be moving in the
	  direction of the hoop for this to occur) for a slam dunk. (Or
	  similar signature move, like a spin move into a finger roll)
	- If a JUMP SHOT then:
		- Letting go of the button will release the ball.
		- Letting go of the button at the peak of jump will increase
		  chances of making the shot.
		- If someone just tapped the button, the computer will shoot
		  the ball after a moment or so. (So it will look correct)
		- If the button is held until jump is almost over, the
		  computer will shoot the ball automatically at that time.
	- If a DRIVE TO HOOP then:
		- Letting go of button as player reaches hoop will increase
		  chances of making the shot.  (Pretty high to begin with!)

- Hitting PASS button while shooting will:
	- If in a JUMP SHOT then:
		- If it isn't to late, player will spin entire body toward
		  teamate and pass the ball.
	- If in a DRIVE TO HOOP:
		- If it isn't to late, and the ball can be easily passed,
		  (Ex. The teamate is vertically aligned with ball carrier
		   allowing an easy swing pass) then pass the ball.
	- If jamming in an ALLEY-OOP pass then:
		- Do nothing.

- If ball is in the air around hoop, then neither team has possession:
	- Player you control (not drone) will squat down (box out type look)
	  and leap up for the ball, or push away opposing player.

PASS Button:
	- If player with ball is running (Dribbling) or standing:
		- Holding button down will cause player to stop dribbling
		  and hold the ball above his head.
		- Pushing joystick will cause that player to spin to the
		  chosen direction.
		- Releasing the button will cause the player to spin to the 
		  direction of his teamate and then pass the ball.
		- The computer will decide if the pass will be a chest pass,
		  chest bounce pass, or arcing lob type pass.
	- If teamate is racing toward the hoop then:
		  (Computer will decide if this will occur.  Based on player
		   positions and directions)
		- ALLEY-OOP may occur.  Computer will take total control of
		  offensive team.  Player with ball will toss a pass toward
		  the hoop and the player who was driving toward the hoop
		  will elevate, catch ball and slam it home.  Computer
		  decides if the jam is successful.  (Pretty high!)

When PASS is caught:
	- When Pass is caught and stick of receiving player is not pushed:
		- Player holds onto the ball.  Possibly going through some
		  kind of a 'look for my teamate' type list for the torso.
		  Don't start dribbling right away because we want to allow
		  the player to use the FAKE button.
	- When player pushes stick:
		- Start dribbling.  Run in selected direction.

TURBO/FAKE Button:
- I assume this button will be used sparingly, and never whacked upon
  repeatedly in quick succession.
- Each player will have a TURBO button meter displayed in his status box.

	- If running:
		- Speed up player you are controlling.
	- If standing and holding onto ball:
		- Fake a shot or hot dog in the face of defender.  Once
		  defender bites on the fake, the player can push stick,
		  which causes him to run around the defender.


Layout for Controls on Defense:

* STICK    * STEAL  * BLOCK/REBOUND
	       * TURBO


BLOCK/REBOUND Button:
	- If ball has reached rim, or is bounding off the rim, then:
		- Player you control (not drone) will face the hoop and squat
		  down (box out type look) and maybe leap up for the ball,
		  or push away opposing player.
			- If ball is generally above his head, then player
			  will jump up and attempt to rebound the ball.  He
			  will even grab the ball and bring it down.

	- If ball has not reached the rim, then we assume a block attempt:
		- Elevate player you are controlling in the direction he
		  is facing.  If ball is nearby, computer will automatically
		  swat the ball away.  Otherwise, player arm is extended high
		  for a block.

STEAL Button:
- I assume this button will be whacked upon repeatedly when defending the
  opponent face to face.
	- Player being controlled will swipe at the ball.
		- If successful, opponent will fall down and you will be
		  in control of the ball with a dribble.

TURBO Button:
	- Causes player you are controlling to speed up his motion.
		- Will not affect jumping, reaching in for a steal, etc.

STEAL & TURBO Button at same time:
	- May cause player you are controlling to execute special defensive
	  move.  Computer will select the appropriate move:
		- Drop down and undercut offensive player as he is gliding
		  toward hoop.
		- Punch player in the face and steal ball.
		- Push player away from hoop.
