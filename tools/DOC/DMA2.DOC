	DMA # 2 - GENERAL INFORMATION

	- THE NEW DMA WILL INCORPORATE BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY TO THE OLD DMA
	IN BOTH PINOUT AND FUNCTIONALITY.

	- THE NEW FEATURES IN ADDITION TO THE OLD ARE AS FOLLOWS:

		1) VARIABLE PIXEL SIZE PROCESSING.  THE NEW DMA CAN PROCESS
		   1 TO 8 BIT PIXELS THAT ARE STORED IN IMAGE MEMORY IN A
		   SERIAL FASHION.

		   EXAMPLE:  5 BIT PIXELS STORED INTO 8 BIT EPROM
		   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		   |P1 |P1 |P1 |P1 |P1 |P2 |P2 |P2 |
		   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		   |P2 |P2 |P3 |P3 |P3 |P3 |P3 |P4 |
		   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		   |P4 |P4 |P4 |P4 |P5 |P5 |P5 |P5 |
		   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		   |P5 |P6 |P6 |P6 |P6 |P6 |P7 |P7 |
		   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

		2) THE NEW DMA CAN BE HALTED IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRANSFER
		   AND THEN BE RESTARTED TO RESUME THE TRANSFER.  THIS IS
		   ACCOMPLISHED BY WRITING A ZERO TO THE DMA GO BIT (BIT 15)
		   IN THE CONTROL REGISTER.  IN THE OLD DMA, THIS WOULD KILL
		   THE TRANSFER SO THAT IT COULD NOT BE RESTARTED.  TO KILL
		   A TRANSFER IN THE NEW DMA, WRITE A ZERO TO THE DMA GO BIT 2
		   TIMES IN A ROW.  TO RESTART A TRANSFER AFTER HALTING,
		   WRITE A ONE TO THE DMA GO BIT IN THE CONTROL REGISTER.

		3) IN ADDITION TO THE CLIPPING ACHIEVED BY MANIPULATING THE
		   OFFSET REGISTER, IN THE NEW DMA, A METHOD OF CLIPPING
		   USING REGISTERED CLIP VALUES IS AVAILABLE. THE HOST CAN
		   SPECIFY CLIP AMOUNTS TO THE DMA AND THE MATH NEEDED TO
		   IMPLEMENT A TRANSFER IS DONE INTERNAL TO THE DMA.

		4) THE NEW DMA CAN DO A TRANSFER FROM THE IMAGE MEMORY TO THE
		   BIT MAP WITH A SCALING EFFECT, I.E. THE IMAGE CAN BE
		   SHRUNK OR ENLARGED.

		5) THE NEW DMA IMPLEMENTS A COMPRESSION MODE IN WHICH LEADING
		   AND TRAILING ZERO DATA PIXELS CAN BE ENCODED IN A RUN LENGTH
		   FASHION TO SAVE ON IMAGE MEMORY.

		6) OFF SCREEN CLIPPING CAN BE AUTOMATIC.  THERE ARE FOUR 
		   REGISTERS THAT SPECIFY THE WINDOW TO WHICH THE DMA CAN
		   TRANSFER DATA.  ACCESS TO THESE REGISTERS IS TRICKY AND
		   IS EXPLAINED BELOW.

		7) NOTE THAT THE CONTROL REGISTER AND THE OFFSET REGISTER
		   HAVE BEEN SWAPPED SO THAT THE MOVE MULTIPLE INSTRUCTION
		   CAN BE USED TO DOWNLOAD THE REGISTERS AND SET DMA GO
		   EFFICIENTLY.

	DMA # 2 - CLIPPING AN IMAGE

	OVERVIEW:
		- AN IMAGE THAT IS STORED IN IMAGE MEMORY CAN BE
		TRANSFERRED TO THE BIT MAP BY THE DMA IN ITS ENTIRETY
		OR WE CAN DMA A PORTION OF THIS IMAGE OUT TO THE BIT
		MAP.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO "CLIP" AN IMAGE BY TRANSFERRING
		ONLY THE PORTION OF THE IMAGE DESIRED.

	IMPLEMENTATION:
		- THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO IMPLEMENT THIS:
			1) THE OFFSET METHOD (OLD STYLE).
			2) THE REGISTER CLIP METHOD (NEW FEATURE).
		- THE OFFSET REGISTER CAN BE CLIPPING PURPOSES:
			REGISTER #0 - CLIP REGISTER - X
		- THIS REGISTER CONTAINS THE AMOUNTS TO WHICH THE IMAGE
		WILL BE CLIPPED IN THE HORIZONTAL OR X DIRECTION.
		- IN REGISTER #0 THE UPPER BYTE IS THE CLIP AMOUNT OFF THE
		LEFT AND THE LOWER BYTE IS THE CLIP AMOUNT OFF OF THE RIGHT
		- TO TURN THE REGISTER CLIPPING CAPABILITY ON, SET THE
		CONTROL REGISTER BIT CLP (BIT 6) TO A ONE.

		EXAMPLES:

		UNCLIPPED IMAGE:
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		|11 |12 |13 |14 |15 |16 |17 |18 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		|21 |22 |23 |24 |25 |26 |27 |28 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

		EXAMPLE 1:
		REGISTER 0 = 0201	 X
		CLIPPED IMAGE:
		+---+---+---+---+---+
		| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+
		|13 |14 |15 |16 |17 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+
		|23 |24 |25 |26 |27 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+

		EXAMPLE 2:
		REGISTER 12 = 0004	 X
		CLIPPED IMAGE:
		+---+---+---+---+
		| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

	DMA # 2 - TRANSFERRING A SCALED IMAGE

	OVERVIEW:
		- A SINGLE IMAGE THAT IS STORED IN IMAGE MEMORY CAN BE
		TRANSFERRED TO THE BIT MAP BY THE DMA AT ITS NOMINAL
		SIZE (1:1) OR AT A "SCALED" SIZE.  THIS SCALING CAN
		TRANSFER AN IMAGE TO THE BIT MAP AT A LARGER OR SMALLER
		RATIO IN THE X OR Y DIRECTION OR BOTH.
		- TO SCALE AN IMAGE, I.E. ENLARGE OR SHRINK, THE IMAGE TO
		BE TRANSFERRED TO THE BIT MAP IS "SAMPLED" BY TRAVERSING
		EACH LINE WITH THE INTENTION OF SELECTING PIXELS FROM THAT
		LINE AT A PREDETERMINED RATE.	THIS RATE CAN BE ONE PIXEL
		PER SAMPLE FOR A 1:1 TRANSFER.	THE VARIANCE OF THIS RATE
		WILL CAUSE THE IMAGE TO BE SCALED TO OTHER THAN 1:1.
		- IF THE RATE IS, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE SAMPLE PER EVERY TWO
		PIXELS, THE IMAGE WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE BIT MAP SKIPPING
		EVERY OTHER PIXEL THUS SHRINKING IT AT A RATIO OF 1:2.
		- IF THE RATE IS ONE SAMPLE PER EVERY ONE HALF PIXELS, THE
		IMAGE WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE BIT MAP DUPLICATING EVERY
		PIXEL THUS ENLARGING IT AT A RATIO OF 1:1/2 OR 2:1.

	IMPLEMENTATION:
		- TWO 16 BIT REGISTERS EXIST FOR SCALING PURPOSES:
			REGISTER # 11 - SCALE REGISTER - Y
			REGISTER # 10 - SCALE REGISTER - X
		- THESE REGISTERS CONTAIN THE RATIOS TO WHICH THE IMAGE
	        WILL BE SCALED (1:FACTOR).
		- IN REGISTER #11 THE UPPER BYTE IS THE FACTOR INTEGER AND
		THE LOWER BYTE IS THE FACTOR FRACTION IN THE Y DIRECTION.
		- IN REGISTER #10 THE UPPER BYTE IS THE FACTOR INTEGER AND
		THE LOWER BYTE IS THE FACTOR FRACTION IN THE X DIRECTION.
		- THE RATIO IS 1:(INT + FRAC/256).
		- TO TURN THE SCALING CAPABILITY ON, LOAD AT LEAST ONE SCALE
		REGISTER WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN 0100 (1:1) SCALING.

		EXAMPLES:

		UNSCALED IMAGE:
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		|11 |12 |13 |14 |15 |16 |17 |18 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

		EXAMPLE 1:
		REGISTER 11 = 0100	 VERT
		REGISTER 10 = 0080	 HORZ
		SCALED IMAGE:
	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

	DMA # 2 - COMPRESSION OF LEADING AND TRAILING ZEROS

	OVERVIEW:
		- TO SAVE IMAGE SPACE, IT MAY BE USEFUL TO DO SOME DATA
		COMPRESSION ON IMAGES.	THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TRY TO DO.
		- IN THEORY, SINCE ALL IMAGES ARE STORED AS RECTANGLES,
		THERE SHOULD BE A SAVINGS IN COMPRESSING THE TRANSPARENT
		PIXELS (I.E. THE ZERO PIXEL DATA).
		- ON A LINE BY LINE BASIS, IF WE HAD INFORMATION PERTAINING
		TO THE NUMBER OF LEADING AND TRAILING ZERO DATA PIXELS, WE
		COULD DO A SIMPLE RUN LENGTH ENCODING OF THESE USELESS PIXELS.
		- FURTHERMORE, IF WE ADDED THIS INFORMATION TO THE ACTUAL
		IMAGE DATA, WE COULD DO AN "ON THE FLY" DECODE OF THIS
		INFORMATION AND ACHIEVE A DECOMPRESSION OF AN ENCODED
		(COMPRESSED) IMAGE, THUS SAVING IMAGE MEMORY AND MONEY.

	IMPLEMENTATION:
		ON SELECTED IMAGES, THE FIRST BYTE WILL BE ALLOCATED
		PER LINE OF THE IMAGE TO INDICATE NUMBER OF LEADING AND
		TRAILING ZERO PIXELS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPRESSED.
		SEE EXAMPLE BELOW:

		UNCOMPRESSED IMAGE:
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		| 0 |18 |18 | 0 | 4 |44 |45 |66 |67 |65 | 0 | 0 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 9 |13 |13 |11 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		|19 |18 |18 | 0 | 0 | 0 |45 |66 |67 |65 |68 |69 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

		COMPRESSED IMAGE:
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		|21 |18 |18 | 0 | 4 |44 |45 |66 |67 |65 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		|34 | 9 |13 |13 |11 | 8 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		|00 |19 |18 |18 | 0 | 0 | 0 |45 |66 |67 |65 |68 |69 |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

		IN THE TOP LINE OF THE COMPRESSED IMAGE,
			THE FIRST BYTE IS A 12:
			1 LEADING ZERO PIXEL, 2 TRAILING ZERO PIXELS

		IN THE CENTER LINE OF THE COMPESSED IMAGE,
			THE FIRST BYTE IS A 43:
			4 LEADING ZERO PIXELS, 3 TRAILING ZERO PIXELS

		IN THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE COMPESSED IMAGE,
			THE FIRST BYTE IS A 00:
			0 LEADING ZERO PIXELS, 0 TRAILING ZERO PIXELS

		THE DMA WILL DECODE THIS PROPERLY IF THE PROPER BITS ARE
		SET IN THE CONTROL REGISTER:
			TM2 - BIT 11 = 0
			TM2 - BIT 10 = 0
			LM1 - BIT 9  = 0
			LM0 - BIT 8  = 0
			CMP - BIT 7  = 1


	DMA # 2 - COMPRESSION OF LEADING AND TRAILING ZEROS (CONTINUED)

	OBSERVATIONS:
		1) THE TOP NIBBLE (4 BITS) OF THE FIRST BYTE IN EACH
		   COMPRESSED LINE REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF TRAILING
		   ZERO PIXELS.

		2) THE BOTTOM NIBBLE (4 BITS) OF THE FIRST BYTE IN EACH
		   COMPRESSED LINE REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF LEADING
		   ZERO PIXELS.

		3) THE OVERALL SAVINGS OF BYTES IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE
		   IS 7 BYTES.

		4) NOTE THAT IN THE BOTTOM LINE WE ACTUALLY USED ONE
		   MORE BYTE THAN BEFORE.  BE CAREFUL OF WHAT IMAGES
		   YOU TRY TO COMPRESS.

		5) THE ABOVE EXAMPLE USES 8 BIT PIXELS.  THE NEW DMA
		   WILL BE ABLE TO MANIPULATE IMAGES OF N BITS PER PIXEL
		   (N = 1 TO 8).  IN THE COMPRESSION MODE, THE ABOVE
		   SCENARIO DOES NOT CHANGE.  EACH LINE WILL START WITH
		   AN 8 BIT VALUE FOR THE COMPRESSION INFORMATION AND
		   THERE FOLLOWS THE PIXELS IN SERIAL FASHION.	THE
		   SAVINGS IN COMPRESSION ARE THEN REALIZED IN PIXELS
		   AND NOT BYTES.

		   BIT SAVINGS = (PIXELS COMPRESSED * BITS PER PIXEL) -
				 (NUMBER OF LINES * 8 BITS).

		6) THE TMx,LMx BITS IN THE CONTROL REGISTER (BITS 8-11,
		   THE COMPRESS MULTIPLIER BITS) CONTROL THE FACTORS WHICH
		   IS MULTIPLIED BY THE NIBBLE DATA TO OBTAIN THE NUMBER
		   OF LEADING/TRAILING ZERO PIXELS.

	DMA # 2 - OFF SCREEN CLIPPING (WINDOWING)

	OVERVIEW:
		- THE OVERHEAD OF CLIPPING IMAGES FOR THE SAKE OF OFF SCREEN
		MANAGEMENT CAN BE REDUCED BY THE WINDOWING FEATURE OF THE
		NEW DMA.

	IMPLEMENTATION:
		- THERE ARE 4 REGISTERS IN THE NEW DMA WHICH SPECIFY
		THE WINDOW BOUNDARIES TO WHICH AN IMAGE CAN BE TRANSFERRED.
		THESE ARE:

	      WINDOW REGISTER # 13 - DESTINATION ADDRESS UPPER LIMIT (WIN = 1)
	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	      | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |	       UPPER LIMIT	      |
	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

	      WINDOW REGISTER # 12 - DESTINATION ADDRESS UPPER LIMIT (WIN = 1)
	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	      | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |	       LOWER LIMIT	      |
	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

	      WINDOW REGISTER # 13 - DESTINATION ADDRESS LEFT LIMIT  (WIN = 0)
	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	      | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |	       LEFT  LIMIT	      |
	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

	      WINDOW REGISTER # 12 - DESTINATION ADDRESS RIGHT LIMIT (WIN = 0)
	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	      | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |	       RIGHT LIMIT	      |
	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

		- THE VALUES THAT CAN BE PUT INTO THESE REGISTERS ARE
		  0 TO 511.

		- ACCESS TO THESE REGISTERS IS AS FOLLOWS:
		  1) SET BIT 5 OF THE CONFIG REGISTER TO A 0 FOR LEFT/RIGHT.
		  2) SET BIT 5 OF THE CONFIG REGISTER TO A 1 FOR UPPER/LOWER.





	DMA # 2 - LIMITATIONS

	OVERVIEW:
		- THERE ARE A FEW LIMITAIONS TO THE FEATURES DESCRIBED
		  ABOVE. THESE LIMITAIONS ARE OUTLINED BELOW.

	SCALING LIMITATIONS:
		- IN GROWING AND SHRINKING OF IMAGES, THERE IS A LIMIT TO
		  WHICH AN IMAGE CAN BE SCALED IN THE X DIRECTION (I.E.
		  HORIZONTALLY). THE LIMIT OF SHRINKING AN IMAGE DEPENDS
		  ON THE NUMBER OF BITS PER PIXEL IN THE IMAGE. THE TABLE
		  BELOW SHOWS THE MAXIMUM SCALE FACTOR THAT CAN BE USED
		  FOR WHAT TYPE OF IMAGES.


		MAXIMUM SCALE FACTOR FOR SHRINK IN X DIRECTION
		----------------------------------------------

		#BITS/PIXEL		INT  FRACTION
		-----------		---- --------
		     1			 1F	FF
		     2			 10	00
		     3			 0A	AA
		     4			 08	00
		     5			 06	66
		     6			 05	55
		     7			 04	92
		     8			 04	00



		MINIMUM SCALE FACTOR FOR GROW IN X DIRECTION
		--------------------------------------------

		#BITS/PIXEL		INT  FRACTION
