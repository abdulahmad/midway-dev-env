This document is an addendum to the FAX document describing the layout
of the background files, *.bdb and *.bdd.

The primary concern of this addendum is to clear up an error in the 
original document.

=========================================================================


The .BDB (Block) file layout is as described originally...


First line...

	(ASCII)	NAME xlength ylength zlength numMods numPals numBlocks


Module Definitions follow of the form...

	(ASCII)	NAME upper_lft_x lower_rt_x upper_lft_y lower_rt_y 
	(There are numMods of these)


Block Definitions follow of the form...

	(ASCII)	univ_Z univ_X univ_Y Hdr Palette
	(There are numBlocks of these)



The .BDD (Data) file begins with an ASCII line

	(ASCII)	number_of_images

For each image there is a header 

	(ASCII)	old_hdr width height big_pal


Image data and palette information follow.

========================================================================


There has been some confusion about the Hdr field in the
Block Definition.  Also the original document stated that the
old_hdr field of the image header could be ignored.  This is not so.

The Hdr field of the block definition will match the old_hdr field of
one of the image headers.

To find which image is associated with a block, you must scan
through the image headers until you find one whose old_hdr
field matches the Hdr field of the block you are working on.

The index of that header is the image index.
