Some questions people ask about LOADIMG...


1)  WHAT IS IT?

	LOADIMG is a program which takes image data out of any number of 
	WIMP image libraries (.img files) and downloads them to good old
	system Z image memory EXACTLY WHERE YOUR PROGRAM EXPECTS IT TO BE!!!
	It can also generate source tables which you can link into your
	program so it knows where to find each image. With the proper flag
	settings, you can have LOADIMG perform either or both of these 
	functions.


2) SOUNDS PRETTY FUCKIN' AMAZING.  HOW DO YOU DO IT?

	Well, frankly, it's magic.


3) HOW DO I GET IT TO WORK FOR ME?

	Follow these simple instructions. It's as easy as 1,2,3!

	First, you must generate a .lod file for your game.  
	This is simply a text file which contains names of WIMP image libraries
	and the images within them which you wish to download. You can
	create this file with a text editor or have WIMP generate it for you.
	(See Note 1 for more details on this)

	Second, invoke LOADIMG with the /t option. This creates six files
	imgtbl.asm, imgpal.asm, imgtbl.glo, bgndtbl.asm, bgndpal.asm and
	bgndtbl.glo.  All of the .asm files should be assembled and linked
	with your program.  The .glo files should be included in any source
	module which references these images.

	Third, before you load your executable, you can invoke LOADIMG with
	no flags. This actually goes into the WIMP .img files specified in your
	.lod file and transfers the data to image RAM.


3)	WHAT ABOUT WHEN MY IMAGES CHANGE?

	If the sizes of the images remain the same and no images are
	added or deleted, you need only redo step 3. If the sizes change,
	but no images are added or deleted, you must redo steps 2 and 3.
	To add or delete images, the .lod file must be edited and then
	steps 2 and 3 repeated.



4)  IT ALL SEEMS SO EASY! WHAT'S THE CATCH?

	No catch! But if you want to risk getting confused, you can read on
	to find out all the nasty details...

     <NOTE 1>
	The .lod file can have any filename. It can be in any directory.
	However, you must set an environment variable SRCDIR to be the
	directory where your .lod file can be found. When WIMP generates
	a .lod file for you, it automatically places it in SRCDIR.
	If SRCDIR is not defined, the directory you are currently in is
	used. The .lod file created by WIMP is always called imgtbl.lod.
	You can rename it if you like. You must manually edit a .lod file
	to combine images from different WIMP .img files.

     <NOTE 2>
	The format for the .lod file is...
	A fully qualified .img filename starting in column 1.
	A series of lines starting with "---> " followed by as many
	image names as will fit on a line separated by commas.
	A line that starts with "BBB> " expects a list of Blimp
	background files.

     <NOTE 3> 
	The files imgtbl.asm, imgpal.asm, imgtbl.glo, bgndtbl.asm,
	bgndpal.asm and bgndtbl.glo are always created in the directory
	which you are in when you invoke LOADIMG.

     <NOTE 4> 
	The invocation for LOADIMG is as follows...
		
		LOADIMG filename flags

		where filename is the name of your .lod file (minus
						a directory and extension)
		and   flag can be  /t - generate tables only
				   /b - generate tables and download images
				   /n - do not detect duplicate data 
				   /v - verbose mode, report lots of stuff

				if omitted, images are downloaded only.
