Hi Bill,


	Some of	the programs enclosed on this disk replace existing 
	utilities -- namely... wlib.exe, loadimg.exe, sdbl.exe, and
	blimp.exe.  If you already have these utilities, you should
	save them somewhere in case you have a problem with the new
	ones.  The difference in these new versions is simply the 
	support of a slight change in the structures used by WIMP.
	The new versions detect and support both old and new WIMP
	files.

	The file newwimp.exe goes in your BIN directory and is used
	just like the old WIMP.  I've also included a batch file called
	nwimp.bat which demonstrates the way in which newwimp can
	set your background and cursor colors on invocation.

	The format is...   newwimp /COL=bgcolr,cursrcolr

		where bgcolr and cursrcolr are 16-bit hex 
		numbers in which bits 0-4 = blue component
				 bits 5-9 = green component
				 bits 10-14 = red component
			       & bit  15  = 0.

				Have fun!

				Warren
