	     The Y-Unit video system is the successor to the Z-Unit
	system that was used in NARC (1989).  The system is designed
	with cost reduction in mind, without taking away the tremendous
	horsepower of the Z-Unit.  Based on the Texas Instruments
	TMS34010 Graphics System Processor, and a custom DMA, Williams
	has created the most powerful coin-operated video game hardware
	for the money.  With its single board layout and JAMMA compatible
	edge connector, it is also competitive in the kit market.

	     The major changes are as follows:

	1)	Reduced image ROM storage from 8 Mb to 2 Mb.
	2)	Reduced program ROM storage from 512K to 256K.
	3)	Jumpers to accomodate contiguous storage of images
		at n bits/pixel.

	     As an added cost savings measure, most games currently
	under development are using a resolution of 256x395x8 rather
	than 400x512x16.  This drastically reduces the storage space
	required for images from ROM to Video RAM.

	     The Y-Unit is theoretically the same as the previous
	system.  The Z-Unit Theory and Maintenance Manual is a very
	comprehensive explanation of the ideas behind the hardware
	operation.  Please refer to this if you wish to explore these
	ideas in depth.  Included with this document is a system memory
	map and a description of the revision 1 DMA.  For operation 
	and programming of the TMS34010 refer to the TMS34010
	user's guide.
