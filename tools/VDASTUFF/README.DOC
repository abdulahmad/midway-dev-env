Mark,

    Here are the steps I used to load the zipped Ultimate MK3
    title screen into program memory. I originally got the file called
    ULT.VDA

;------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Convert ULT.VDA into a zipped BIN file called ULT.BIN by
   running Warren's batch file called VDA2FRM.BAT which calls:

        PKZIPO.EXE  (you must use this old version of PKZIP)
        ZIP2BIN.EXE (converts pkzips output to a BIN file)

;------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Make an LOD file which includes your BIN file in PROGRAM memory
   My LOD file (mkgmil.lod) looked like this:

;
;  mk3: program area pics
;
***> ffe78000     <-------- note: this is PROGRAM area I chose
ASM> MK3ZIP.TBL   <----- table file created with LABEL: ULT
FRM> ULT

      ^
      |
      |_____ ULT is the binary file created with Warrens batch file



;------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Include the LOD file in your "Make game roms" batch file
   This is my batch file to create my game program ROMS It uses the
   "learn" file: mk3groms.lrn


@echo off
copy d:main.out
srec < mk3groms.lrn
copy /b mainf8.0 + mainfa.0 + mainfc.0 + mainfe.0 mk3.0
copy /b mainf8.1 + mainfa.1 + mainfc.1 + mainfe.1 mk3.1
erase mainf*.0
erase mainf*.1


   This is the "learn" file which I described.
   Note: mkgmil.irw is included along with main.out which
   basically included the zipped picture in the program rom
   space.

c:\video\supermk3\img\mkgmil.irw      <----- mkgmil is the GAME space IRW
main.out

;------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Running Loadimg with the MKGMIL.LOD file created a file called
   MK3ZIP.TBL which contains:


	.DATA
ULT	.set	0ffe78000h
	.TEXT


   You must include this file in your code so you can point the
   unzipper routine to the address of the zipped picture.



;------------------------------------------------------------------

5. In your program call the unzipper like dis:


         clr	a10			; a10 = coordiantes to use
	movi	ULT,a8			;  a8 = address of zipped picture
	jsrp	movie_run
